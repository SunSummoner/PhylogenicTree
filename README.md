# PhylogenicTree
->Multiple Sequence Alignment and phylip tree of a protein of influenza virus.<br>
->Data for some of the birds of Corvidae family.I've added the gene ND1 mitochondrian DNA of some of the birds from NCBI.<br>
-> NOTE That for MUltiple Sequence Alignment the name of the protein should be changed so that its shorter that 10 characters and should not begin with a speacial character.
